Connect Vin to the power supply, 3-5V is fine.

Use the same voltage that the microcontroller logic is based off of.

Connect GND to common power/data ground.

Connect the SCL pin to the I2C clock SCL pin on your Arduino.
On an UNO & '328 based Arduino, this is also known as A5, on a Mega it is also known as digital 21 and on a Leonardo/Micro, digital 3.

Connect the SDA pin to the I2C data SDA pin on your Arduino.
On an UNO & '328 based Arduino, this is also known as A4, on a Mega it is also known as digital 20 and on a Leonardo/Micro, digital 2
